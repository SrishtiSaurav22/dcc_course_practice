Loretta
Broke my heart in a letter
She told me she was leaving
And her life would be better
Joan
Broke it off over the phone
After the tone
She left me alone
Jen said she'd never ever
See me again
When I saw her again
She said it again
Jan
Met another man
Lisa got amnesia
Just forgot who I am
Felicity
Said there was no electricity
Emily
No chemistry
Fran ran
Bruce turned out to be a man
Flo had to go
I couldn't go with the flow
Carol Brown
Just took a bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll
Stick around
<br><br>
He doesn't cook or clean
He's not good boyfriend material
We can eat cereal
He loses interest fast
His relationships never last
Shut up, girlfriends from the past
He says he'll do one thing
And then he goes and does another thing
Who organized all of my ex-girlfriends
Into a choir and got them to sing?
Who, who? Shut up
Shut up girlfriends from the past
<br><br>
Mimi
Will no longer see me
Britney
Britney hit me
Paula, Persephone
Stella and Stephanie
There must be fifty ways
That lovers have left me
Carol Brown
Just took a bus out of town
<br><br>
Love is a delicate thing
It could just float away on the breeze
He said the same thing to me
How can we ever know
We've found the right person in this world
He means he looks at other girls
Love is a mystery
It does not follow a rule
This guy is a fool
He'll always be a boy
He's a man who never grew up
I thought I told you to shut up
<br><br>
Mona
You told me you were in a coma
Tiffany
You said that you had an epiphany
Would you like a little cereal?
Who organized this choir of ex-girlfriends?
Was it you, Carol Brown?
Was it you, Carol Brown?
Carol Brown
Just took a bus out of town
But I'm hoping that you'll stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
Stick around
